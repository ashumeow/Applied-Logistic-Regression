For this exercise, you will need the Myopia Study dataset. <br>
Download the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/MYOPIA.dta">MYOPIA.dta</a> Stata file, <br>
or you can also access the data through this <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/data/MYOPIA-fixed.csv">CSV file</a>.

One variable that is clearly important is the initial value of spherical equivalent refraction (SPHEQ).

Complete the following:

A. Write down the equation for the logistic regression model of SPHEQ on MYOPIA. 
Write down the equation for the logit transformation of this logistic regression model. 
What characteristic of the outcome variable, MYOPIA, leads us to consider the logistic regression model as opposed to the usual linear regression model to describe the relationship between MYOPIA and SPHEQ? 
Discuss your response in the homework forum.

B. Form a scatterplot of MYOPIA vs. SPHEQ.

C. Write down an expression for the likelihood and log likelihood for the logistic regression model in part (A) using the ungrouped, n=618, data. 
Obtain expressions for the two likelihood equations.

D. Using Stata, obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the logistic regression model in part (A). 
These estimates should be based on the ungrouped, n=618, data. Using these estimates, write down the equation for the fitted values, 
that is, the estimated logistic probabilities. 
Plot the equation for the fitted values on the axes used in the scatterplots in parts (B) and (C).
