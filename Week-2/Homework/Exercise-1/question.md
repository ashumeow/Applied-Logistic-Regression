For this exercise, you will need the Myopia Study dataset that we also used in week one. <br>
Download the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/MYOPIA.dta">MYOPIA.dta</a> Stata file, <br>
or you can also access the data through this <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/data/MYOPIA-fixed.csv">CSV file</a>.
```
Complete the following:

Using the results of the output from Stata, 
assess the significance of the slope coefficient for SPHEQ using the likelihood ratio test and the Wald test. 

What assumptions are needed for the p-values computed for each of these tests to be valid? 

Are the results of these tests consistent with one another? 

What is the value of the deviance for the fitted model?

You can share your response and discuss this exercise in the homework forum.
