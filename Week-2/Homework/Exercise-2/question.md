For this exercise, you will need the ICU Study dataset that we also used in week one. <br>
Download the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/data/icu.dta">icu.dta</a> Stata file, <br>
or you can also access the data through this <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/logisticregression/data/icu.csv">CSV file</a>.
```
Using the results of the output from the logistic regression package used for Exercise Two - Part (D) of week one, 
assess the significance of the slope coefficient for AGE using the likelihood ratio test and the Wald test. 

What assumptions are needed for the p-values computed for each of these tests to be valid? 

Are the results of these tests consistent with one another? 

What is the value of the deviance for the fitted model?

To recall from week one: exercise two-D prompted you to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the logistic regression model in part (A). 

These estimates should be based on the ungrouped, n=200, data. 

Using these estimates, write down the equation for the fitted values, 
that is, the estimated logistic probabilities. 

Plot the equation for the fitted values on the axes used in the scatterplots in part (B).

You can share your response and discuss this exercise in the homework forum.
