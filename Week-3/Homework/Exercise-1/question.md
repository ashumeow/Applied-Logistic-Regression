For this exercise, 
you will use the Myopia Study dataset and you will need to refer to the results from Week Two, Exercise 1. 
If you need the file you can download the MYOPIA.dta Stata file, or you can also access the data through the CSV file.

Complete the following:

Using the results from Week Two, 
Exercise 1, compute 95 percent confidence intervals for the slope coefficient SPHEQ. 
Write a sentence interpreting this confidence.
Use Stata (or your preferred analysis software tool) to obtain the estimated covariance matrix. 
Then compute the logit and estimated logistic probability for a subject with SPHEQ = 2. 
Then evaluate the endpoints of the 95 percent confidence intervals for the logit and estimated logistic probability. 
Write a sentence interpreting the estimated probability and its confidence interval.
You can share your response and discuss this exercise in the homework forum.
