What type of association do you expect between the variables female and runtime? 

Answer this question before looking at the data, 
only on the basis of the observed change in the coefficient for female when runtime is entered into the model. 

Then make a box-plot of runtime by female.
```
```stata
. graph box runtime, over(female)
```
